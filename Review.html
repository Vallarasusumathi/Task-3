        <p>The Apple MacBook Air is excellent for school. It's very portable, and its battery lasts easily through a typical day of light use. It has a sharp and bright display, a comfortable keyboard, and a large and responsive touchpad. Its M2 SoC can easily handle general productivity tasks, like text processing, web browsing, and video playback. The SoC's GPU performs reasonably well but loses performance when it gets hot, so it isn't ideal for students in fields like 3D design.</p>

    <h5 class="scl"><span class="badge bg-warning">6.4</span>Gaming</h5>
    <p>The Apple MacBook Air is mediocre for gaming. Although the M2 SoC's CPU is very capable, its GPU can't handle graphically-intensive games, so you'll have to play at a lower resolution or low settings to achieve playable frame rates. Also, few games have been optimized for the ARM-based SoC, meaning performance can vary a lot from one game to another. The display has a slow response time, causing noticeable ghosting, and it doesn't support variable refresh rate to reduce screen tearing.</p>

        <h5 class="scl"><span class="badge bg-info">7.9</span>Multimedia</h5>
        <p>The Apple MacBook Air is good for media consumption. It's easy to carry around due to its thin and light design, and its battery lasts about seven hours of video playback, enough time to get through a couple of full-length movies. The speakers get reasonably loud and sound full and well-balanced with a good amount of bass. The display is sharp, bright, and color-accurate; however, blacks look gray in dim settings as it's an IPS panel with no local dimming multimedia is good performance.</p>

        <h5 class="scl"><span class="badge bg-dark">8.0</span>Business</h5>
    <p>The Apple MacBook Air is great for business use. It has a sturdy aluminum chassis and is very portable, thanks to its thin and light design. Its M2 SoC is powerful enough to handle most productivity tasks, like text formatting, spreadsheets, and presentations, and you can even do some occasional photo and video editing. The battery lasts a little more than 10 hours of light use, so you likely won't need to bring the charger. The display is sharp and bright, the keyboard is comfortable.</p>
